<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I had an important video call that I needed to carry out under Ubuntu as I need to demo some of my work. About two minutes before it was due to begin, I noticed that my pings to the home network router were ridiculously variable and high:<br/>
<ul><tt><span style="color: #00007f"><li style="list-style-type: none">PING 192.168.0.1 (192.168.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">64 bytes from 192.168.0.1: icmp_req=1 ttl=64 time=60.3 ms</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">64 bytes from 192.168.0.1: icmp_req=2 ttl=64 time=82.9 ms</li>
</span></tt><li style="list-style-type: none"><tt><span style="color: #00007f">64 bytes from 192.168.0.1: icmp_req=3 ttl=64 time=105 ms</span></tt></li>
</ul>
<br/>
Awful.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, two minutes before an important call is not the time to be tinkering with network settings, so I left it at the time. Fortunately, it didn't seem to adversely affect the call.<br/>
<br/>
Later, I booted into Windows to find my pings were perfectly normal (1 ms)1. So, what's the issue under Linux?<br/>
<br/>
What it turns out to be is wireless power management. You can easily test this by trying:<br/>
<br/>
sudo iwconfig wlan0 power off<br/>
<br/>
and remeasuring the pings:<br/>
<ul><tt><span style="color: #00007f"><li style="list-style-type: none">64 bytes from 192.168.0.1: icmp_req=1 ttl=64 time=0.970 ms</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">64 bytes from 192.168.0.1: icmp_req=2 ttl=64 time=1.04 ms</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">64 bytes from 192.168.0.1: icmp_req=3 ttl=64 time=0.994 ms</li>
</span></tt><li style="list-style-type: none"></li>
</ul>
Much better!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to this forum thread, I found an easy way to make this fix permanent, you need to do something like:<br/>
<ul><tt><span style="color: #00007f"><li style="list-style-type: none">sudo nano /etc/pm/power.d/wireless</li>
</span></tt><li style="list-style-type: none"></li>
</ul>
and add the following lines to the newly created file:<br/>
<ul><tt><span style="color: #00007f"><li style="list-style-type: none">#!/bin/sh</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"></li>
</span></tt><li style="list-style-type: none"><tt><span style="color: #00007f">/sbin/iwconfig wlan0 power off</span></tt></li>
</ul>
<br/>
Next, do:<br/>
<ul><li style="list-style-type: none"><tt><span style="color: #00007f">sudo chmod +x /etc/pm/power.d/wireless</span></tt></li>
</ul>
<br/>
so that this script is executable.<br/>
<br/>
Next time you reboot, the fix should still be in place.<br/>
<br/>
1I have a feeling that I disabled any wireless power management on Windows when I first installed it a few months back; it may be that you'd suffer a similar problem in Windows too otherwise.<br/>

<b>A Build Lifecycle is Made Up of Phases</b><br/>
<br/>
Each of these build lifecycles is defined by a different list of build phases, wherein a build phase represents a stage in the lifecycle.<br/>
<br/>
For example, the default lifecycle comprises of the following phases (for a complete list of the lifecycle phases, refer to the Lifecycle Reference):<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #00007f">validate</span>&nbsp;&#09;&#09;validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available<br/>
<span style="color: #00007f">compile</span>&nbsp;&#09;&#09;compile the source code of the project<br/>
<span style="color: #00007f">test</span>&#09;&#09;&#09;test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed<br/>
<span style="color: #00007f">package</span>&nbsp; &#09;&#09;take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.<br/>
<span style="color: #00007f">integration-test</span>&nbsp;&#09;process and deploy the package if necessary into an environment where integration tests can be run<br/>
<span style="color: #00007f">verify</span>&nbsp;&#09;&#09;run any checks to verify the package is valid and meets quality criteria<br/>
<span style="color: #00007f">install</span>&nbsp;&#09;&#09;install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally<br/>
<span style="color: #00007f">deploy</span>&nbsp;&#09;&#09;done in an integration or release environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.<br/>
<br/>
These lifecycle phases (plus the other lifecycle phases not shown here) are executed sequentially to complete the default lifecycle. Given the lifecycle phases above, this means that when the default lifecycle is used, Maven will first validate the project, then will try to compile the sources, run those against the tests, package the binaries (e.g. jar), run integration tests against that package, verify the package, install the verifed package to the local repository, then deploy the installed package in a specified environment.<br/>
<br/>
To do all those, you only need to call the last build phase to be executed, in this case, deploy:<br/>
<ul><li style="list-style-type: none"><tt><span style="color: #00007f">mvn deploy</span></tt></li>
</ul>
<br/>
That is because if you call a build phase, it will execute not only that build phase, but also every build phase prior to the called build phase. Thus, doing<br/>
<ul><li style="list-style-type: none"><span style="color: #00007f"><tt>mvn integration-test</tt></span></li>
</ul>
<br/>
will do every life cycle phase before it (validate, compile, package, etc.), before executing integration-test.<br/>
<br/>
There are more commands that are part of the lifecycle, which will be discussed in the following sections.<br/>
<br/>
It should also be noted that the same command can be used in a multi-module scenario (i.e. a project with one or more subprojects). For example:<br/>
<ul><li style="list-style-type: none"><span style="color: #00007f">mvn clean install</span></li>
</ul>
<br/>
This command will traverse into all of the subprojects and run clean, then install (including all of the prior steps).<br/>

<b><span style="font-size: 12pt">Introduction</span></b><br/>
<br/>
By using Proxmox VE live snapshots you can preserve the KVM virtual machine state. A snapshot includes the contents of the virtual machine memory, virtual machine settings, and the state of all the virtual disks. When you rollback to a snapshot, you restore the memory, virtual disks and all settings of the virtual machine to the state they were in when you took the snapshot.<br/>
You can take a snapshot and continue to use the virtual machine from that point, take another snapshot at a later point, and so on. You can rollback to the snapshot of a previous known working state of the project if the changes do not work as expected.<br/>
If you are testing software, you might want to save multiple snapshots as branches from a single baseline in a process tree. For example, you can take a snapshot before installing different versions of an application to make sure that each installation begins from an identical baseline.<br/>

<br/>
In order to use Proxmox VE live snapshots all your virtual machine disk images must be stored as qcow2 image or be in a storage that supports live snapshots and is managed by Proxmox (like Ceph’s RADOS Block Device (RBD)). Future version will support also Sheepdog or Nexenta.<br/>
Difference between LVM snapshots and Live snapshots<br/>
<br/>
LVM snapshots are used for doing backups. Live snapshots are used to preserve the state of KVM virtual machine.<br/>

<br/>
<b>Backup</b><br/>
<br/>
If you want to (live) backup a VM containing snapshots you need at least Proxmox VE 2.3. Please note, snapshots are not included in the backup - see backup logs.<br/>

</b><b>VM´s with a lot of RAM</b><br/>
<br/>
As each snaphots needs to save the whole RAM to disk you need to make sure there is enough space on your storage. If you use a lot of RAM in the VM it takes some time to save it.<br/>

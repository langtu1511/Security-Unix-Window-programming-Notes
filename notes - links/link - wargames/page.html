Using these skills outside of these sites could result in arrest and imprisonment! Some sites will allow you to hack them, and some will only allow you to do their hacking challenges on the site.

This list has been compiled to be if not “the best list out there”. We decided to write this article after hunting for these kind of sites, and finding all the list we found were no good.We scoured through hundreds of sites. And found many broken links. As well as many sites unrelated. The criteria for this list was very specific. And we only found 11 sites which held up to our standards. &nbsp;Sites with broken links were not accepted. And we only accepted sites where one can actually commit the act of hacking. All the sites are free as well. Of course some may have bonus challenges for a donation (some one has to pay the bill). But we guarantee you will find hundreds of free ones from this list! If you dig them, don’t be shy to donate and help them out (us too haha). They go in order from our favorite to least favorite. But all deserve applause! Just click on the image or orange link to view each site. And here we go!<br/>
<br/>
<b><a href="http://www.enigmagroup.org/">#1 Enigma Group</a>: </b> The Enigma Group comes in first place due to their mentor feature! Now of course other sites have forums. But this is a set list of users, who said “Hey, I did it! I would love to help you through it.”. Or after you complete it, you can be a mentor and help out others! All mentoring does, is put you on a list of people for others to private message for help with a certain level. This site is packed with a current total of 174 challenges!<br/>
<br/>
<b><a href="https://www.hackthissite.org/">#2 Hack This Site</a>:</b> Hack This Site is by far the most well known and popular site on this list. And it has 95 hacking challenges with more on the way! If you complete all the challenges, you can hack the actual site and earn a spot on their “Hall of Fame”. We are also very excited about their Phonephreaking Missions, which are on the way. This is the only site we know of with these types of missions in the works!<br/>
<br/>
<b><a href="https://www.hellboundhackers.org/">#3 Hell Bound Hackers</a>:</b> Hell Bound Hackers have an astonishing 166 challenges! They have a very hands on approach, and great community to get involved with! With currently over 80,000 members there is no shortage of support for this hacker training ground. They currently have projects in place to update most of their site. We can’t wait to see the new look! And we hope to see it around for long time!<br/>
<br/>
<b><a href="https://hack.me/">#4 Hack Me</a>:</b> Hack Me is not like any other site on the list! You don’t do challenges set up by the site. But rather challenges set up by users. You can even be a developer and upload your own hacking challenges for people to try! This site is growing and might even be the biggest one day! While other sites have communities which help, no one does it like Hack Me! We hope you join and contribute to this unique project.<br/>
<br/>
<b><a href="http://www.overthewire.org/wargames/">#5 Over The Wire</a>:</b> This is for all those Linux junkies out there! Instead of hacking via the web site, you remote into their server! This definitely requires some more skill on the Linux side. They have 96 hardcore challenges spread out among multiple war games, not for the faint of heart! They also have scoring through a third party system. You will need to understand basic Linux command line to set it up. But well worth it!<br/>
<br/>
<b><a href="http://google-gruyere.appspot.com/">#6 Google Gruyere</a>:</b> Learn from Google how to beat hackers at their own game via Google Gruyere. They have awesome hints, tips and explanations! I mean it’s from Google, what more do you need to know? Surely the experts at Google know their stuff, how to make a vulnerable web app, and teach you to become a hacker! You can look forward to 10 walk though sections ranging a variety of exploits.<br/>
<br/>
<b><a href="https://www.hackthis.co.uk/">#7 Hack This</a>:</b> Hack This makes you work from the ground up. You can’t move on until you complete the grunt work in order from bottom to top! You even get points just for logging on! They give you points towards your ranking score for many different things. For instance log-in every day for a week, or month. And logging in after being registered for a month or year each gain you points. It currently holds 41 challenges with more on the way!<br/>
<br/>
<b><a href="http://smashthestack.org/wargames">#8 Smash The Stack</a>:</b> Smash The Stack has 6 currently available wargames, which can change at any time. With multiple levels in each. This is another site for Linux lovers. Plugging into a server for an attack just feels so good! As far as we know, no official scoring system is in place. Instead you just leave your mark by appending tags to files. Of course these files are visible on certain web pages. Just be sure to view them at your own risk!<br/>
<br/>
<b><a href="http://www.bright-shadows.net/">#9 Bright Shadows</a>:</b> Bright Shadows has the most missions of all the sites currently holding at 342 challenges and growing! This site is very well thought out. They have lots of good tips for getting started. And never ending missions to sooth your urges. One cool things is you can see how many users have completed each challenge. And it’s a badge of honor to say you solved a mission very few did!<br/>
<br/>
<b><a href="http://www.net-force.nl/challenges/">#10 Net Force</a>:</b> Net Force has 93 challenges! Registration is currently closed but you can still do levels. i.e. view them and their solution. But your progress will not be saved. This kind of seems like a project which was abandoned. But never the less, there is still stuff to be learnt on it. We have tried contacting them, with no response. Maybe if enough people try to contact them, it will go back into full swing!<br/>
<br/>
<b><a href="http://www.try2hack.nl/">#11 Try 2 Hack</a>:</b> Try 2 Hack has 13 levels with more on the way. No log-in i.e. way to keep track. But it does have some challenges for you to face! And any experience is good experience. They have an IRC channel as most do for support. We hope to see what this site can become. It has been around for a long time. But development on it has been very slow. Hopefully they get some serious players involved to speed up development.<br/>
